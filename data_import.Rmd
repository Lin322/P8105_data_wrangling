litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
#read_csv is a fucntion in the readr package
#the "." means from the folder where the R project file is located, aka. start here
litters_df

#below start the data cleaning from rename the variables:
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
#janitor is another package that need to be loaded here, double ":" to load, and that use the function "clean_name" in jamitor to rename the variables into snake_form. 

```

head(litters_df)
tail(litters_df)
```
```{r}
skimr::skim(litters_df)
#give a brief look of the basic data descriptive infomation like missing, means, and histgram, ect. 
#also wa can type "view(litters_df"in cosole instead of rmd chunk to open a new window of the dataset. (open new window in rmd will make knit harder)
```
